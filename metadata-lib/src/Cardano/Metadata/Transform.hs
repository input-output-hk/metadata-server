An algebra for describing transformations and their combination.

Mapping, combining, and sequencing are provided via the Functor,
Applicative, and Monad typeclasses (respectively).

The property we are specifically looking for with this type is that
"combining" two transformations (using the Applicative typeclass) is
the same as applying the input to both transforms and then combining
the result:

  âˆ€t1 t2 input. apply (t1 *> t2) input = apply t1 input *> apply t2 input.

Importantly, plain-old functions (->) DO NOT satisfy this constraint.
Hence the definition of a new "function-like" type.
